<title>THE HEART THAT WAS BROKEN FOR ME</title>
<stanza>
1. There came from the skies in the days long ago
The Lord with a message of love;
The world knew Him not; He was treated with scorn 
This wonderful gift from above
</stanza>
<chorus>
They crowned Him with thorns
He was beaten with stripes
He was smitten and nailed to the tree
But the pain in His heart
Was the hardest to bear
The heart that was broken for me...

The sheep that had wandered astray;
They heard not His voice, But the Friend of mankind
Was hated and driven away

He was beaten with stripes
He was smitten and nailed to the tree
But the pain in His heart
Was the hardest to bear
The heart that was broken for me...

But He had no place for His head;
A pallet of stone on the cold mountain side
Was all that He had for His bed.

He was beaten with stripes
He was smitten and nailed to the tree
But the pain in His heart

Dishonour and wound Him again;

Be willing to suffer the pain.

I will walk by His side
For the pathway of duty I see
I will follow my Lord
And abide in His heart,
The heart that was broken for me...

<title>THE CHURCH'S ONE FOUNDATION</title>
<stanza>
1. The church's one foundation 
Is Jesus Christ her Lord; 
She is His new creation 
By water and the Word. 
From Heav'n he came and sought her 
To be his holy bride; 
With his own blood He bought her, 
And for her life He died. 
</stanza>

2. Elect from every nation, 
Yet one o'er all the earth; 
Her charter of salvation, 
One Lord, one faith, one birth;

Partakes one holy food, 
And to one hope she presses, 
With every grace endued.
</stanza>
<stanza>
3. Though with a scornful wonder 
Men see her sore oppressed, 
By schisms rent asunder, 
By heresies distressed, 
Yet saints their watch are keeping; 
Their cry goes up, "How long?" 
And soon the night of weeping 
Shall be the morn of song. 
</stanza>
<stanza>
4.	Mid toil and tribulation, 
And tumult of her war, 
She waits the consummation 
Of peace for evermore; 
Till with the vision glorious, 
Her longing eyes are blest, 
And the great church victorious 
Shall be the church at rest. 
</stanza>
<stanza>
5. Yet she on earth hath union 
With God the Three in One, 
And mystic sweet communion 
With those whose rest is won. 
O happy ones and holy! 
Lord, give us grace that we,
Like them, the meek and lowly, 
On high may dwell with thee.

1. More love to Thee, O Christ,
More love to Thee!
Hear Thou the prayer I make
On bended knee;
This is my earnest plea: 
More love, O Christ, to Thee;
More love to Thee, 
More love to Thee!

Sought peace and rest;

Give what is best.

More love, O Christ to Thee;
More love to Thee, 
More love to Thee!
</stanza>

Whisper Thy praise;
This be the parting cry 
My heart shall raise;
This still its prayer shall be:
More love, O Christ to Thee,
More love to Thee, 
More love to Thee!

The billows are tossing high!

When each moment so madly is threatening
A grave in the angry deep?

O hasten, and take control!

The elements sweetly rest;

And with joy I shall make the blest harbour,
And rest on the blissful shore.

Yet my lord was despised and rejected of men,
This Jesus of Calvary

Whoever came, no matter how afflicted,
Was sure a sovereign remedy to find.

Now bring our sick ones to the Lord in prayer
Right through the throng of unbelieving scruples,

Nor feared to take the "chastisement" away;

1. If to Christ our only King
Men redeemed we strive to bring,
Just one way this may be done -
We must win them one by one.
 </stanza>
 <chorus>
So you bring the one next to you,
And I'll bring the one next to me;
In all kinds of weather,
We'll all work together,
And see what can be done.
If you'll bring the one next to you,
And I bring the one next to me,
In no time at all we'll have them all,
So win them, win them, one by one.
</chorus>
<stanza>
2. Side by side we stand each day,
Saved are we, but lost are they;
They will come if we but dare
Speak a word backed up by prayer.
</stanza>
<chorus>
So you bring the one next to you,
And I'll bring the one next to me;
In all kinds of weather,
We'll all work together,
And see what can be done.
If you'll bring the one next to you,
And I bring the one next to me,
In no time at all we'll have them all,
So win them, win them, one by one.
</chorus>
<stanza>
3. Only cowards dare refuse,
Dare this gift of God mis-use;
Ere some friend goes to his grave,
Speak a word his soul to save.
</stanza>
<chorus>
So you bring the one next to you,
And I'll bring the one next to me;
In all kinds of weather,
We'll all work together,
And see what can be done.
If you'll bring the one next to you,
And I bring the one next to me,
In no time at all we'll have them all,
So win them, win them, one by one.
</chorus>
<stanza>
4. Not for hope of great reward
Turn men's hearts unto the Lord;
Just to see a saved man smile
Makes the effort well worthwhile.
</stanza>
<chorus>
So you bring the one next to you,
And I'll bring the one next to me;
In all kinds of weather,
We'll all work together,
And see what can be done.
If you'll bring the one next to you,
And I bring the one next to me,
In no time at all we'll have them all,
So win them, win them, one by one.

The song of victory.

These signs shall surely follow them 
Who on My Name believe."

Who on My Name believe."

Who on My Name believe."

Who on My Name believe."

"These signs shall surely follow them 
Who on My Name believe."

In the shelter of the fold;

Far off from the gates of gold -
Away on the mountains wild and bare;
Away from the tender Shepherd's care.
Away from the tender Shepherd's care.

Are they not enough for Thee?"

I go to the desert to find My sheep
I go to the desert to find My sheep."

How deep were the waters crossed;
Nor how dark was the night the Lord passed thro'

Sick and helpless, and ready to die,
Sick and helpless, and ready to die.

That mark out the mountain's track?"

Ere the Shepherd could bring him back."

"They're pierced tonight by many a thorn;
They're pierced tonight by many a thorn."

And up form the rocky steep.

"Rejoice, for the Lord brings back His own!
"Rejoice, for the Lord brings back His own."

Tho' you gain the whole world for your own?...

<title>THE GREAT JUGEMENT MORNING</title>
<stanza>
1. I dreamed that the great judgment morning
Had dawned, and the trumpet had blown;
I dreamed that the nations had gathered
To judgment before the white throne;
From the throne came a bright, shining angel,
And he stood on the land and the sea,
And he swore with his hand raised to Heaven,
That time was no longer to be.
 </stanza>
 <chorus>
And, O, what a weeping and wailing,
As the lost were told of their fate;
They cried for the rocks and the mountains,
They prayed, but their prayer was too late.
</chorus>

<stanza>
2. The rich man was there, but his money
Had melted and vanished away;
A pauper he stood in the judgment,
His debts were too heavy to pay;
The great man was there, but his greatness,
When death came, was left far behind!
The angel that opened the records,
Not a trace of his greatness could find.
</stanza>
<chorus>
And, O, what a weeping and wailing,
As the lost were told of their fate;
They cried for the rocks and the mountains,
They prayed, but their prayer was too late.
</chorus>

<stanza>
3. The widow was there with the orphans,
God heard and remembered their cries;
No sorrow in heaven forever,
God wiped all the tears from their eyes;
The gambler was there and the drunkard,
And the man that had sold them the drink,
With the people who gave him the license,
Together in hell they did sink.
</stanza>
<chorus>
And, O, what a weeping and wailing,
As the lost were told of their fate;
They cried for the rocks and the mountains,
They prayed, but their prayer was too late.
</chorus>

<stanza>
4. The moral man came to the judgment,
But self-righteous rags would not do;
The men who had crucified Jesus
Had passed off as moral men, too;
The soul that had put off salvation,
"Not tonight; I'll get saved by and by,
No time now to think of religion!"
At last they had found time to die.
 </stanza>
 <chorus>
And, O, what a weeping and wailing,
As the lost were told of their fate;
They cried for the rocks and the mountains,
They prayed, but their prayer was too late.

1. O brother, life's journey beginning,
With courage and firmness arise!
Look well to the course thou art choosing;
Be earnest, be watchful, and wise!

And both thy attention invite;
But one leadeth on to destruction,
The other to joy and delight.

No matter what others may do;

If you, in the name of the Lord,
Fight manfully under your Leader,
Obeying the voice of His Word.

And share by and by in the glory
That never shall vanish away.
